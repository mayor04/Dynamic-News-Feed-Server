# Dynamic News Feed Server


##Introduction
A server in NodeJS which utilizes mongo DB database to allow users to post news/articles, view posted news/articles and filter content to other user based on their interest.
This is more of a demo backend to most popular news hosting sites that filters content based on the user likes and clicks. User would need to have created an account and is authorized before the content would be filtered based on his preference. All content would be posted by admins with different categories to ensure effective filtering


##How it works
A simple and effecient UI has been created to enable admins to add site.
This project uses
  - Express
  - Body parser(for handling post requests)
  -
